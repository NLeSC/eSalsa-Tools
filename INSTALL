The binary release of eSalsa Tools does not require any special installation.
Simply unzip the distribution where you want. Then set the ESALSA_HOME 
environment variable to this location. For easy access you may also want to 
add "$ESALSA_HOME/scripts" location to your PATH. 

This software requires Java SE 6.0 or higher (also known as Java 1.6). It has 
not been tested with older versions.
